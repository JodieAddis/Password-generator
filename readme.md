# "Password Generator"

## About the project

This application allows users to generate random passwords. These are generated based on the criteria selected by the users: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols. The password can be copied/pasted via an icon. The generator also indicates the strength of the password according to levels: 'too weak', 'weak', 'medium', and 'strong'.

## Objectives

Creation of a password generator working with Typescript, modules, and unit tests. The design is implemented using the Tailwind framework.
